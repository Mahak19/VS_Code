        <p>Breakfast</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Greek literature, there are numerous mentions of ariston, a meal taken not long after sunrise. The Iliad notes this meal with regard to a labor-weary woodsman eager for a light repast to start his day, preparing it even as he is aching with exhaustion.[7] The opening prose of the 16th book of the Odyssey mentions breakfast as the meal being prepared in the morning before attending to one's chores.[8] Eventually ariston was moved to around noon, and a new morning meal was introduced.</li><br>
            <li>In the post-Homeric classical period of Greece, a meal called akratisma was typically consumed immediately after rising in the morning.[7] Akratisma (ἀκρατισμός, akratismos) consisted of barley bread dipped in wine (ἄκρατος, akratos), sometimes complemented by figs or olives.[9] They also made pancakes called tēganitēs (τηγανίτης), tagēnitēs (ταγηνίτης).[10] or tagēnias (ταγηνίας),[11] all words deriving from tagēnon (τάγηνον), meaning "frying pan".</li><br>
            <li>Breakfast in some times and places was solely granted to children, the elderly, the sick, and to working men. Anyone else did not speak of or partake in eating in the morning. Eating breakfast meant that one was poor, was a low-status farmer or laborer who truly needed the energy to sustain his morning's labor, or was too weak to make it to the large, midday dinner</li><br>
            <li>Asian food incorporates a few significant provincial cooking styles: Central Asian, East Asian, North Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian. A food is a trademark way of cooking practices and customs,[1] usually associated with a specific culture. Asia, being the largest and most populous continent, is home to many cultures, many of which have their own characteristic cuisine. Asian cuisine are also famous about their spices.</li><br>
            <li>Ingredients common to many cultures in the East and Southeast regions of the continent include rice, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chilies, dried onions, soy, and tofu. Stir frying, steaming, and deep frying are common cooking methods. </li>
